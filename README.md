# Plotly_Github_Pages

## Overview of the project
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Analysis

1. Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
* Using the knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, we create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. 
* The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

2. Create a Bubble Chart
* Using the knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, we create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:

  The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
  The sample_values as the y-axis values.
  The sample_values as the marker size.
  The otu_ids as the marker colors.
  The otu_labels as the hover-text values.

3. Create a Gauge Chart
* Using the knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, we create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

4. Customize the Dashboard
*Add an image to the jumbotron.
*Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.
*Add more information about the project as a paragraph on the page.
*Make the webpage mobile-responsive.
